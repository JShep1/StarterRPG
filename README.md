# StarterRPG
A small game I built to learn the ins and outs of Godot.

This game was primarily me following the quite amazing tutorials by HeartBeast which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a).  If anyone wants to start learning Godot, I would 100% recommend going through those tutorials to begin.
